## Introduction
Sentiment Analysis is a widely used application of data science, particularly for analyzing user sentiments on social media platforms. This project uses a Twitter dataset to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, leveraging deep learning models to achieve meaningful insights from user opinions. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/twitter-sentiment-dataset).

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the Twitter dataset for modeling.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of LSTM for sentiment classification.
- **Evaluation**: Model evaluation to determine accuracy and optimize parameters.

## Installation
To run this project, install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow keras streamlit
